# Smeltery Controller

This program aids in converting fluids into items. Simply select a fluid, then
click "cast selection." Alternatively, just click "cast all."

The controller will leverage attached tables, basins, and drains to cast
everything

## What works?

- Casting blocks, ingots, and nuggets.

## What does not work, but is planned?

- Casting gems
- Storing data about maximum space in the smeltery and unknown liquids.
